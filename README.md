# lan and play

This project is my first fullstack application and i created it out of my love for the sense of community i got out of lan partys early on as teenager.

I feel the need to bring a sense of community together with further iterations of this web app. Wether it's playing mario kart 64 or counterstrike with a group of friends I created this for all gamers to find an event closest to them. If there is not one, no problem! Register and start creating your own events.
